This README outlines a potential data project for the Downtown Women's Center.

## Notes from 10/25/2016

__Goal:__ Empower Women

__How:__ Make an interface + database

### How the Facility works:

These are the characters of our story:

* Chief Program Manager - needs Service Counter metrics.
* Day Center Manager - needs statistics, and a way to quickly and securely add new participants
* Service Providers - Manage usage of showers, food, etc.
* Case Workers - Triage participants asking for housing, etc.
* Participant "Annabelle" - homeless or low income women who need services.

Sample Participant interactions - "Annabelle" enters the Day Center and has the option of:

1. Receiving meals, showers, etc.
2. Requesting services in the Health Center.
3. Going to a Case Manager for triage to receive housing/shelter.

### What the interface needs to do:

1. It needs to make all the character's lives easier.
 - AnnaBelle wants services provided quickly and easily without feeling shame or unease. It's already very brave of her to come here. She doesn't need any unneccessary roadblocks to entry.
 - The Managers need good reliable data to report to their funders and to make decisions about the Center that will more effectively empower Annabelle.
 - The Service Providers need a super-simple system to tally Annabelle using their services so they can give her better access and make their volunteer time hassle-free.
 - The Case Workers need a sysyem that is easy and intuitive and allows them to make the right decision regarding annabelle's request for housing or counseling.
 - Basically the service Providers and Case workers need a system that is so easy to use it disappears in their hands and allows them to see Annabelle clearly and help empower her future. They're volunteering their time, they definitely don't need bullshit. They need profuse thank-yous from as many who are emotionally able to give it.

### Testing and Iterating:

We will iterate upon this design by repeadedly making something that is as bare-bones as possible.
This will allow us to make the inveitable changes that will be required.

How to iterate: Have the people who will be using it try it out.
ask them: "How would you interact with this form?"

So we will test and adjust:
1. How does the user interact with the form?
2. Does it make their job easier and more sustainably rewarding?
3. Does it allow them to empower Annabelle more readily?
4. Does it provide the data the Managers need to make better decisions to empower Annabelle?
5. __Most Importantly:__ _Is Annabelle being empowered more quickly and effectively?_

### What you can do:

Check the issues section: Grab one and work on solving the problem. 

Make sure to communicate with the team so your solution integrates with the rest of the system. (Or just build it already integrated) 

Work that is not done by the end of the session may be tagged as homework, but if it is not completed by the following session, your work is lost! Someone else will have a chance to complete the issue.

If any issues have losses more than twice in a row, we should consider breaking the issue into smaller more manageable chunks.
